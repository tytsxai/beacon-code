# Upstream merge policy rules
#
# Format (tab-separated):
#   <category> <severity> <glob> <note>
#
# - category: upstream_owned | downstream_owned | shared
# - severity: info | warn | fail
#
# Rules are matched in-order; the first matching rule sets the category.
# Separately, any matching rule with severity warn/fail will be recorded in
# the "High-risk matches" section.
#
# Glob matching uses bash patterns (e.g. "codex-rs/*", ".github/workflows/*").

downstream_owned	info	docs/zh/*	Chinese localization is fork-owned.
downstream_owned	warn	code-rs/code-auto-drive-core/*	Core fork feature; ensure upstream merges do not regress.

shared	warn	code-rs/*	Primary development area; manual review required.
shared	warn	docs/*	Docs often need manual merge to preserve fork sections.
shared	warn	README.md	Manual merge required for fork branding/sections.
shared	warn	config.toml.example	Config template; merge carefully.
